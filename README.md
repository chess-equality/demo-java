## What is this?

This project holds standalone demonstrations of Source++ features available for Java. These demonstrations are meant to
be used as a reference for how to use Source++ in your own projects.

## Demos

### [Tail Logs](./src/main/java/spp/demo/command/TailLogs.java)

This demonstration shows how to tail logs from a running application. Logs can be filtered by individual statements,
methods, and classes. The **Tail Logs** command works for any application that uses a logging framework that is supported by Source++.

For more information, see the Javadocs in the [Tail Logs](./src/main/java/spp/demo/command/TailLogs.java) class.
